# tcxfilter
From a set of TCX files (e.g. a Smashrun export), copy only the subset starting in a given latitude/longitude box.

Built to pair nicely with [my fork](https://github.com/joshcvt/heatmap) of [sethoscope/heatmap](https://github.com/sethoscope/heatmap), so I can build maps of specific areas without making it crunch through 750 other files.

Built with the sometimes-terrifying assistance of [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com).
